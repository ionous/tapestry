This documents the commands used in <code>.tell</code> story files. 

There are two different views of the api. The [definition files](/api/idl) where all of the commands are defined. And, the [slot index](/api/slot) which categorizes the commands by type.

For the Go language reference, see <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/git.sr.ht/~ionous/tapestry">pkg.go.dev</a>
