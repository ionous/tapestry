# fix? the rules for deciding whether something starts with a vowel ( and therefore should use indefinite article 'an' )
# are defined by the "starts with vowel" pattern. so, even though, we've explicitly said "an x" in the declaration: that doesn't matter.
# ImportNouns() doesn't see the "an" as being special, and so doesn't get assign the noun a customized indefinite article.
# ( Inform also has this issue. )
# Potentially, the importer could call the "starts with vowel" pattern, and when true store the article.
# Or, maybe we could store the (various) articles used when defining the noun, sort through them, and pick the most reasonable one -- always storing that regardless.
# saying only ever "the X" , for example, would be remembered, but wouldn't alter the set of indefinite articles.
