# Game world modeling using English-like sentences.
# For example:
#
#  The kitchen is a room. The closed container called the cabinet is in the kitchen.
#  The cabinet contains a mug. The mug is transparent.
#
# The commands in this idl aren't used directly by authors. Instead, these commands are created as a byproduct of reading a sentence. Each successfully matched English sentence results in a single [matched_phrase] with exactly one valid member.
#
# The types of sentences jess can process are based on the sentences described in Inform7's documentation. However, Inform can handle a much wider range of sentences than jess.
