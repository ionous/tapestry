# Tapestry

**Tapestry** is an experimental interactive fiction engine, with the goal of creating game stories for any game genre â€” independent of a game's graphics.

You can find the full documentation at [tapestry.ionous.net](https://tapestry.ionous.net/) ðŸ“š, and the Go language API on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/git.sr.ht/~ionous/tapestry). The project and its source code are hosted on [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~ionous/Tapestry/).  A mirror lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/ionous/tapestry) which can be used for forks and PRs.

# Status

Tapestry is a work in progress. 

You can [![Play](https://img.shields.io/badge/Play%20%E2%86%97-blue)](https://tapestry.ionous.net/cloak-of-darkness.html) a small example in your browser ( the "Cloak of Darkness", ported from [Roger Firth's original](https://www.ifwiki.org/Cloak_of_Darkness) ), and there's some preliminary integration with the [Godot game engine.](https://godotengine.org)  

I hope to continue expanding Tapestry's capabilities as my time allows.
